In the Fall 2024 Semester I served as a grader for Dr. John Valasek and Dr. Hannah Lehman's AERO 321 course on the Dynamics of Aerospace Vehicles.

Course Material
======
This course covered a the derivation of the nonlinear air and space vehicle dynamics equations; attitude representation with Euler angles and quaternions; forces and moments due to aerodynamics, thrust and gravity gradient; linearization; development of state-space models for aircraft and spacecraft; static and dynamic stability analysis for aircraft and satellites; spin and gravity gradient stabilization; stability derivatives; longitudinal and lateral modes and transfer functions for aircraft; aircraft flying qualities; elements of aircraft configuration design; response to control inputs. 

Responsibilities
======
As a grader for AERO 321, I was responsible for evaluating and grading student assignments that involved the derivation of nonlinear air and space vehicle dynamics equations. For example, I applied my knowledge of the DATCOM method, dynamic modes, and aircraft stability to assess students' understanding of the theory. After grading assignments, I promptly returned them within a week and worked with students to resolve any grading conflicts or clarify course policies.
