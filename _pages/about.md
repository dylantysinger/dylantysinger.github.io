Howdy! My name is Dylan Tysinger. I am a senior Aerospace Engineering student at Texas A&M University, graduating in 2025, with a strong academic and hands-on background in unmanned aerial systems (UAS), avionics, and aerodynamics. My experience spans various leadership, research, and technical roles, showcasing expertise in complex system design, simulation, and optimization. I am currently seeking admission to a PhD program where I can pursue research in autonomous systems.

For my Senior Capstone project, I worked on an interdisciplinary Senior Capstone team for Los Alamos National Laboratories to develop a UAS-based Aerial Reconnaissance System, where I created a 3-DOF dynamics simulation to predict flight performance which could be further expanded for Conrol System Design, and I designed a high-resolution data-acquisition system for Aerial Reconnaissance. As an intern with Garmin International's Automatic Flight Control Systems Team, I organized the development of MATLAB and Simulink tools for flight data analysis, created a web interface for automated plotting, and led workshops for engineers on these analysis tools.

On the Texas A&M SAE Aero Design Team, I worked within an AGILE/SCRUM framework as an Aerodynamics, Stability, and Controls Engineer, where I lead a small team to develop a reconfigurable flight dynamics code, and have used genetic algorithms to optimize airfoil designs for a STOL UAS design. I also created simulations, conducted CFD analyses, and analyzed flight tests on multiple UAS designs. 

Research Interests
======
I am an undergraduate researcher in the Intelligent Systems Research Lab, where I developed a Simulink model for interfacing with the PX4 flight control system. I have recently been exploring the world of embedded systems programming, where I am using Simulink to write code for embedded flight control systems. My research interests include: 
* Modeling and Simulation of Aerospace Vehicles
* Control System Design
* Autonomous Systems Reliability
* Airplane Design Optimization
* Embedded Systems


Teaching Experiences
======
I served as a grader for AERO 321, Dynamics of Aerospace Vehicles, addressing students' concerns and grading assignments. I led exam review sessions for Aerospace Engineering undergraduate students through Sigma Gamma Tau. I also mentor students in Sigma Gamma Tau and hold a leadership role in Reformed University Fellowship at Texas A&M. My experiences on student design teams, capstone teams, and my work experiences evidence my technical knowledge, leadership, and teaching skills.

Professional Societies
------
I'm a member of Sigma Gamma Tau at Texas A&M, the National Aerospace Engineering Honor Society, and I am also a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) and the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). My academic achievements include the Craig and Galen Brown Engineering Honors at Texas A&M, the Joanne & Edward "Pete" Aldridge Scholarship, and the Dean's Honor Award for Academic Achievement.
