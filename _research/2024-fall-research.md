The research focuses on developing an integrated hardware and software autopilot system designed to facilitate the seamless integration of advanced flight control algorithms onto hardware. The project aims to create a versatile platform that enabled researchers to easily incorporate their own algorithms, allowing them to focus on testing and development rather than the complexities of autopilot system design. The work involved creating embedded flight control algorithms for attitude estimation and control of a vehicle using Simulink. Future work aims to implement the software and hardware system on a physical platform, such as a quadcopter.
